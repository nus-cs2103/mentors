# CS2103/T Student Mentors

The job of _student mentors_ is to pitch in to help solve technical problems posted in the forum by current students. Given below are some guidelines.

* Only the problems that are not resolved within a reasonable period need inputs of student mentors.
  * Mentors should **step in only if an issue is not resovled within 6 hours** of the original posting, to give current students a chance to respond first.
  * The prof will inform you when mentor help is needed for an issue by posting in the [`mentors` issue tracker](../../issues). In those cases, you can respond immediately.
* You are expected to 'watch' this repo (i.e., the `mentors` repo) so that you get notified when the prof posts in the mentors issue tracker seeking your help.
* Student mentors are not required to (but are welcome to) _watch_ the [forum](../../../forum/issues).
* Optionally, student mentors **can guide current students about forum usage** best practices. Some examples:
  * point out missing information in a help request
  * remind a student to close a resolved issue
* **Do not answer admin questions** (e.g., questions about module requirements). Even tutors are prohibited from answering admin questions. Prof will answer those.
* **It's best not to answer theory questions** too. This is because it is hard for you to keep track of which topics have been covered by a specific time in the module. It can confuse students if your answer refers to topics not covered yet.
* **Avoid duplicate answers** by checking the prior posts in the thread** before posting yours as the same answer might be already present in the thread. Otherwise you might end up creating _spammy_ posts.
* If you have questions/suggestions, you can post in the [`mentors` issue tracker](../../issues).
