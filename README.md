# CS2103/T Student Mentors

The job of _student mentors_ is to pitch in to help solve technical problems posted in the forum by current students.
 Given below are some guidelines.

* It is important that current students get the first crack at solving technical problems as it is one of the
  module learning outcomes.<br>
  Therefore, **only the problems that are not resolved within a reasonable period need inputs of student mentors**.<br>
  Hence, the workload is expected to be very light
  (because the current students are likely to be able to resolve most issues among themselves).
* You will be informed when mentor help is needed for an issue, via a post in the
  [`mentors` issue tracker](../../issues). In those cases, you can respond immediately.
* You are expected to 'watch' the mentors repo so that you get notified when the prof posts
  in the mentors issue tracker seeking your help.
* Student mentors are not required to (but are welcome to) _watch_ the [forum used by students](../../../forum/issues).
* Optionally, student mentors **can guide current students about forum usage** best practices. Some examples:
    * point out missing information in a help request
    * remind a student to close a resolved issue
    * mention GitHub features (e.g., fenced code syntax) the student can use to improve the post
* Optionally, student mentors **can supplement resolved issues**  by adding more info e.g., why the solution works,
  alternative solutions not mentioned.
* **Do not answer admin questions** (e.g., questions about module requirements).
  Even tutors are prohibited from answering admin questions. Prof will answer those.
* **It's best not to answer theory questions** too.
  This is because it is hard for you to keep track of which topics have been covered by a specific time in the module.
  It can confuse students if your answer refers to topics not covered yet.
* **Avoid duplicate answers** by checking the prior posts in the thread** before posting yours
  as the same answer might be already present in the thread. Otherwise you might end up creating _spammy_ posts.
* **Mentioning that you are from a previous batch** when answering questions might be good. e.g.,
  > Hi @abc, I'm from your senior batch (dropping by in this forum to see if I can help you guys with tech problems).
  > Can you check if ...

If you have questions/suggestions, you can post in the [`mentors` issue tracker](../../issues).
