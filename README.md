# CS2103/T Student Mentors

The job of _student mentors_ is to pitch in to help solve technical problems posted in the forum by current students. Given below are some guidelines.

* Only the problems that are not resolved within a reasonable period need inputs of student mentors.
  * Normally, mentors can step in if an issue is not resovled within 6 hours of the original posting.
  * The prof will inform you when mentor helps is needed for an issue by posting in the [`mentors` issue tracker](../../issues). In those cases, you can repond immediately.
  * It is best not to respond within the the first 6 hours of an issue, to give current students a chance to respond first. 
* You are expected to 'watch' this repo (i.e., the `mentors` repo) so that you get notified when the prof posts in the mentors issue tracker seeking your help.
* Student mentors are not required to (but are welcome to) _watch_ the [forum](../../../forum/issues).
  If a forum thread needs the attention of student mentors, they will be notified by the teaching team.
* Optionally, student mentors can guide current students about forum usage best practices. Some exampples:
  * point out missing information in a help request
  * remind a student to close a resolved issue
* If you have questions/suggestions, you can post in the [`mentors` issue tracker](../../issues).
